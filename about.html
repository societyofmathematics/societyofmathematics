  <h1>About the Society of Mathematics at Boston University </h1>   
</header>

<statement style="font-size: 110%">
The aim of the Society of Mathematics is perhaps best evoked by the following passage from Virginia
Woolf's <em>A Room of One's Own</em>:
<blockquote>
	And thus by degrees was lit, half-way down the spine, which is the seat of the soul, not that
	hard little light which we call brilliance, as it pops in and out upon our lips, but the more
	profound, subtle, and subterranian glow which is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse.
</blockquote>
The quote beautifully describes the intelectual and material environment of a dinner at the
fictional college "Oxbridge". This dinner, which she so venerates for being exemplary of 'rational
intercourse', is open only to a select few; the goal of our Society is to extend opportunities to
experience firsthand profound, subtle, and subterranian glow of rational discourse to all the walks
of life; primarily, to all types of undergraduate.
