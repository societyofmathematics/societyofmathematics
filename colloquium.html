<h3>Root Systems and Lie Groups</h3>
<h4>Zoe Siegelnickel</h4><br>
A root system is a collection of vectors definied over a Euclidian vector space with certain
	geometric properties. Some of the isometries
generated by these roots form a group called a Weyl group. These groups are
used extensively to study various symmetries. We will do a brief introduction
to Euclidean space, isometries, and root systems before discussing Weyl groups
and Weyl chambers and how they appear in Lie Theory.

<h3><a href = 'elliptic-curves.pdf'>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a></h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
The digital world is kept secure by cryptography. The idea behind most
modern cryptographic systems is that if I have a public number (some sort of
seed) and a secret number (usually called a private key) I can perform some
operation with them to generate a third number (which usually called a public
key). The public key is easy to generate by combining a seed and a private key,
but hard to generate any other way; this allows us to verify the authenticity of a
private key very easily. One such operation involves finding collinear points on
an elliptic curve, giving rise to elliptic curve cryptography. This talk introduced
elliptic curves over finite fields, explained how we can use their geometry to define
an appropriate operation, and touched on why this operation is appropriate
for cryptography. Slides for the talk can be found <a href="slides.pdf">here</a>.
